    f"""\033[93mRemember that compiling with MCL will never be as fast as writing a datapack yourself.
Many things require workarounds to function as expected: strings, dicts, lists, and even basic arithmetic.
To make the final code significantly faster, use class functions wherever you can.
For example, a + b is a general operation, and at runtime, the types must be checked in order to retain all the data.
Instead, int.add(a, b) or double.add(a, b) can be used to skip this type check

Other examples include .get() for dictionaries\033[0m""")
