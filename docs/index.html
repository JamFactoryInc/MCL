                Welcome to MCL

            <h2>
                What is MCL?
            </h2>
            <p>
                MCL is a datapack generator program that reads python code <br> No mods, no new languages or syntax, no nonsense. <br> <br> MCL allows the user to use python to define complex behavior that is difficult to manage with obtuse datapack syntax.
            </p>

            <h2>
                Runtime over Compile Time
            </h2>
            <p>
                MCL was built to allow for as much runtime functionality as possible.<br>If you're unclear, runtime is undefined behavior. For example:
                <code class='prettyprint'>user_input = input()
print(user_input)</code> There's no way to make this work unless you define the variable <code class='inline'>user_input</code> at runtime. <br> On the other hand, compile-time is pre-defined behavior. Such as:
                <code class='prettyprint'>print(1+2)</code> This will always print 3, and so there is no need to ever add 1 and 2. All that is compiled is the equivalent of <code class='inline'>print(3)</code>
            </p>


            <h2>
                Why Choose MCL
            </h2>
            <p>
                There are reasons to and not to use MCL. Here are some pros and cons:
                <h4>
                    Pros
                </h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        MCL is loosely-typed and supports many data types
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        MCL uses identical syntax to python (with some necessary amendments)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Performance aside, essentially anything possible in vanilla python is possible in MCL
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h4>
                    Cons
                </h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        MCL is not as efficient. Many nbt operations are done in order to allow for runtime capability and these are more expensive
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        MCL is abstracted away from the commands. While command injection/direct manipulation is supported and encouraged, the resulting datapack will be essentially nonsense and hard to edit yourself if you wish to make changes outside of the MCL coding env
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        MCL is young and only maintained by one developer. Some day support and updates may stop if I become too busy or am otherwise unable
                    </li>
