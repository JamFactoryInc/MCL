                What is MCL

                MCL is not java. Watch your step.
            </h3>
            <p>
                MCL is a Java-<i>like</i> language that is compiled down into a datapack to whatever degree is possible in Minecraft. <br>
                It's Java-<i>like</i> because there are a number of builtin classes and methods that are different. Additionally, I've taken things from python and C# that I think are more intuitive than Java

                What are the Limitations of MCL?
            </h2>
            <h3>
                Most languages compile to a lower-level-language. MCL compiles into Minecraft Commands. Not quite as capable as x86 assembly.
            </h3>
            <h4 id="#compiletime">
                To kick things off, let's define some things.
            </h4>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong> Compile-time variable</strong>: a variable that changes with the logic of the program, but when it reaches an endpoint, it becomes static. <br>
                    After it compiles it will never change. For example, this works: <br>
                    <code class="prettyprint">
                        Cstring str = "Hello, world!"; <br>
                        str = str[0:5]; <br>
                        //str is now "Hello" <br> <br>
                        print(str); <br>
                        //MCL will print "Hello" to the chat.
                    </code>
                    <br>
                    And this does not:
                    <br>
                    <code class="prettyprint">
                        //Summons a new zombie at (0,0,0)<br>
                        Zombie zomb = new Zombie(0,0,0); <br> <br>
                        
                        Cstring str = "Hello, world!" + zomb.UUID[0]; <br>
                        //MCL can't access the UUID of the Zombie, and because Minecraft does not allow for string concatenation, <br>
                        //it is impossible to assign this variable. <br> <br>
                        str = str[0:5]; <br>
                        print(str); <br>
                    </code> <br>
                    This is a big problem in MCL that can't really be resolved, but I can add as much functionality as I can. <br>
                    For example, <code class="prettyprint">string str = "Hello, world!" + zomb.Pos[0]</code> does work, as MCL knows what nbt data was used to summon the Zombie 
                    <br> and simply recalls these values. <br>
                    There's no way to garuntee that this data is accurate. <br>
                    For example, if <code class="prettyprint">Zombie zomb = new Zombie(0,0,0);</code> is run one tick before <code class="prettyprint">string str = "Hello, world!" + zomb.Pos[0]</code>, <br>
                    anything could happen to the zombie in this tick outside of what has been defined in MCL.
                </li>
                <br> <br>
                <li>
                     <strong> Run-time variable</strong> : floats, ints, and arrays are Runtime variables, meaning that they can directly interact with the Minecraft world. <br>
                    This kind of thing works with runtime variables:
                    <br>
                    <code class="prettyprint">
                        //Summons a new zombie at (0,0,0)<br>
                        Zombie zomb = new Zombie(0,0,0); <br> <br>
                        
                        int num = 5 + zomb.UUID[0]; <br>
                        //when this line runs, whatever the first section of the zombie's UUID will be added to 5 and stored in the variable 'num' <br> <br>

                        print(num); <br>
                        //MCL will print the value of 'num'
                    </code> <br>
                </li>
            </ul>   
            <br>
            <h4>
                Now let's talk about the magic, or rather cursed number: 2147483647
            </h4>
            <p>
                2147483647 is the largest number able to be stored in an integer, and unfortunately, Minecraft Scoreboards only store values as integers. <br>
                Doubly unfortunately, the only real way to do math in Minecraft (for the most part) is with Scoreboard operations. <br> <br>
                Why is this a problem? <br>
                Well, have you ever wanted to add 1 + 1.5? <br>
                Too bad, you meant 1 + 1. <br>
                TL;DR, basically <strong> runtime floats in mcl only hold 3 decimal places, and have a maximum of 2147482.999.</strong> <br>
                Compile-time floats are just normal floats, but once they hit runtime they get cut down. <br> <br>
                This [2147482.999, -2147483.999] limit is not permanent, as there are workarounds, but as it stands, this is just a limitation of the language.
            </p>
            <h4>
                MCL is in beta
            </h4>
            <p>
                And because of this, it's missing some functionality. <br>

            <h4>
                MCL isn't as Efficient
            </h4>
            <p>
                In order for MCL to have the capability that it does, it has to run a number of extra commands that would otherwise not be run if programming a datapack by hand. <br>
                But you're probably not using MCL for its speed. You're using it for its ease of use. <br>
                Of course, the processing overhead introduced is as small as possible and can always be decreased, but it will never be as fast as programming a datapack yourself. <br> <br>
                If you want to have a more hands-on approach, you have direct access to all of Minecraft's commands through the builtin classes.
