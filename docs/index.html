                Welcome to MCL
            </h1>

                What is MCL?
            </h2>
            <p>
                MCL is is a language designed to be intuitive, consistent, and concise. <br>
                Most of it is a hybrid of C# and Python with a few extra sprinkles here and there. <br>
                <br>
                MCL is compiled into a standard Datapack. No mods, no nonsense. <br> <br>

                MCL allows the user to use a high-level language to write Datapacks instead of wrangling the normal commands in a txt file.
            </p>

            <h2>
                Runtime variables
            </h2>
            <p>
                You heard me. I've spent a long time allowing as much runtime functionality as absolutely possible. <br>
                Summoning 100 Zombies named "Zombie 0" to "Zombie 100" is as easy as 
                <code class='prettyprint'>
                    for i in 100 <br>
                    { <br>
                        Zombie z = Zombie(); <br>
                        z.name = "Zombie " + i; <br>
                    }
                </code>
            </p>

            <h2>
                The "It just works" mentality is dumb
            </h2>
            <p>
                While giving the user the highest level of abstraction away from the actual commands, MCL retains the ability to inject commands inline for those hands-on vets among you,
                as well as having a clear distinction between runtime and compiletime values.
            </p>

            <h2>
                Trident
            </h2>
            <p>
                <a href="https://energyxxer.com/trident/" class='link' target="_blank">Trident</a> is a language that was developed by
                 <a href="https://twitter.com/Energyxxer" class='link' target="_blank">Energyxxer</a> for the same purpose as MCL. <br> 
                 It's a Datapack language. <br>
                 I've tried it and it's not for me. The reason I didn't want to learn Trident was its complexity and its lack of runtime variables. <br>
                 Everything else about it is great, and I recommend giving it a look
